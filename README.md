# Mealprep-

This app is your quirky new Meal Planner, acting as a edible-choice lottery! You pick a food category (like "Dessert"), and it instantly dives into the internet's recipe book to pull out one random, delicious dish, giving you the ingredients and instructionsâ€”because deciding what to cook is often harder than the actual cooking.
